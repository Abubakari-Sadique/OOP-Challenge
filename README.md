# 🐾 Abu the Digital Pet – Python OOP Challenge

Welcome to **Abu the Digital Pet**, a simple but fun Python project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 🐶✨

This project was created as part of the [Python OOP Challenge](https://github.com/Evans-mutuku/OOP-Challenge). It helps reinforce the use of classes, objects, attributes, methods, and user interaction in Python.
